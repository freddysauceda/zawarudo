Originally the alliance between the human Kingdom of Etso and the elvish Calen Emirate, the Great Kingdom of Aldia 
is the successor state following their victory in the Aldian Unification War. 

### Politics
Humans and Elves share positions in the upper reaches of the government, while Dwarves can hold local offices or
lower ranking military positions but will almost never be able to rise above an Elf or a Human above them. All other
races are not tolerated in any higher office and are effectively bound to be peasants for life.

### Geography
To the west is Kushnan Desert, inhospitable to most Aldians, but not to the Kushnan 'Bandit' Confedaracy who have made
it their home somehow. Northwards, the kingdom connects to Aerd's northern icecap, home to the disparate beast tribes
a majority of which are giants. To the east is the Crescent Island Empire, their largest neighbor and rival. The south 
holds many small islands, serving as the entrances to a secretive underground dwarven civilization called Underhaven
by other dwarves.
