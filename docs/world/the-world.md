## General

Aerd is a world of relative peace and stability. Made up of two continents, Aldia and Nundia and a 
number of large islands scattered about its surface. News of what occurs on each continent travels slow
over the dividing sea as few captains are skilled enough to make the journey across and even fewer mages
are skilled enough to teleport just themselves between the two.

### Magic

Most everyone in Aerd can do some minor magic, creating a tiny spark of flame, maintaining a dim light,
or a gentle gust of wind to move a piece of paper. However, going beyond these miniscule feats is intensely 
more difficult. Only a small selection of those that study magic for years are able to call themselved wizards, 
and even fewer are able to have such natural talent to be sorcerer. For this reason, the number of mages under
employ of a nation is a good barometer of their total military strength.
